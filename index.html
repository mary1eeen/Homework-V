<h3>Three</h3>
A young boy named <b>Rudo</b> lives in the slums of a wealthy society among the <b>"tribesfolk"</b>, a population descended from criminals and exiled by society. Rudo detests the upper class's wastefulness, as they often dump anything deemed trash, including criminals, into a massive dump site below the town known as <b> "The Pit" </b>. Rudo was told by his foster father Regto that his biological father was dumped into the Pit for a crime before Rudo was born. One day, after rummaging through a dump site, Rudo returns home to find Regto murdered. Apprehended at the scene, Rudo is immediately charged with murder despite being innocent, due to his status as a tribesman. Unable to escape his fate, Rudo swears revenge upon the people and is dumped into the Pit.
There's been <b>terrorist attacks</b> on going around as the northerners are taking the upper hand and hopefully the aboki you're owing suya money wouldnt be the one to kill you. People be carrying <em>guns and knives</em> to church nowadays, guess all that free fire paid off 😂.
